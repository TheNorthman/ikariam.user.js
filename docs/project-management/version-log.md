# TNT Collection Version Log

## 🚀 Version 1.5.31 (Current) - Stable Foundation Release
**Release Date:** 2025-06-14  
**Status:** ✅ Stable - Production Ready

### 🎯 Major Achievements
- ✅ **Stable Core Architecture**: Error-free Core script with comprehensive functionality
- ✅ **Independent Dev Environment**: Separate development tools for safe experimentation
- ✅ **Memory Space Documentation**: Proper understanding of userscript isolation
- ✅ **Clean Project Structure**: Organized documentation with lowercase naming convention
- ✅ **Git Repository**: Both Core and Dev scripts committed safely

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Core Script (v1.5.31)**: Production-ready, runs independently in its own memory space
- **Dev Script (v1.0.2)**: Development tools, separate `tnt` object, includes tooltip testing
- **Documentation**: Properly organized under `docs/` with consistent lowercase naming
- **File Structure**: Clean organization following modern conventions

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Scripts run in isolated memory spaces - cannot directly call each other
- Use `window` object for cross-script communication when needed
- Each script maintains its own independent `tnt` object
- Always test scripts separately to ensure independence

### 🚀 Ready for Development
- Tooltip system investigation using `tntTestTooltip()` function
- Ikariam's native `bindBubbleTip` integration
- Enhanced user experience features
