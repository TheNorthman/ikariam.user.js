# üö® CRITICAL: NEVER TOUCH THE PRODUCTION FILE

## THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE - ABSOLUTE PROTECTION

**File**: `c:\Projects\Private\Ikariam\tnt.collection\tnt.collection.user.js`

## üõë FORBIDDEN ACTIONS - NEVER EVER DO THESE:

‚ùå **NEVER modify this file directly**  
‚ùå **NEVER suggest changes to this file**  
‚ùå **NEVER include this file in code suggestions**  
‚ùå **NEVER treat this as a working file**  
‚ùå **NEVER apply fixes directly to this file**  

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:

‚úÖ **Always work in**: `dev/tnt.collection.core.user.js`  
‚úÖ **For styles**: `dev/tnt.collection.styles.user.js`  
‚úÖ **For experiments**: `dev/tnt.collection.dev.user.js`  
‚úÖ **Production is BUILT, not edited**  

## üèóÔ∏è BUILD PROCESS ONLY

The production file is created by:
1. Developing in Core/Dev/Styles
2. Testing thoroughly  
3. Merging via build process
4. **NEVER direct editing**

## üö® IF YOU SEE THIS FILE IN A PROMPT:

**STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not suggest any changes to it!
**REDIRECT** - Point to the appropriate dev file instead!
**PROTECT** - This file represents what users actually run!

---

**REMEMBER**: This file is sacred. It's what users install. Breaking it breaks everything for everyone.

## üîí AI ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

### For AI Tools Working on TNT Collection:

1. **üõë RECOGNITION CHECK**: Is `tnt.collection.user.js` mentioned in the prompt?
   - **YES**: STOP - Do not suggest changes to this file
   - **NO**: Continue with development work

2. **üéØ REDIRECT PROTOCOL**: When production file is mentioned:
   ```
   ‚ùå I cannot modify the production file `tnt.collection.user.js`
   
   ‚úÖ For your [issue/feature], I should work on:
   - Core functionality: `dev/tnt.collection.core.user.js`
   - Styling: `dev/tnt.collection.styles.user.js`  
   - Experiments: `dev/tnt.collection.dev.user.js`
   
   The production file is built from these development files.
   ```

3. **üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTION MANTRAS**:
   - "The production file is sacred"
   - "Development happens in dev/, not production"
   - "Build process creates production, never edit it directly"
   - "Breaking production breaks everything for users"

### Why This Matters:

- **Users depend on it**: This file is what people actually install
- **Version v1.5.22**: Currently stable and working for users
- **Breaking changes**: Direct edits can break functionality for everyone
- **Build process**: Production should only be updated via proper build/merge process

### Emergency Protocol:

If there's a critical production issue:
1. **Fix in Core/Dev files first**
2. **Test thoroughly**
3. **Use proper build process**
4. **Never emergency-edit production directly**

---

## üìã CURRENT STATUS

- **Production Version**: v1.5.22 (stable)
- **Development Version**: v1.5.26 (Core file - active development)
- **Protection Level**: MAXIMUM - Never touch production file
- **Last Production Update**: Should only be via build process

**This protection document exists because production file integrity is CRITICAL for all TNT Collection users.**
