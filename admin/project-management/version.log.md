- ✅ **Clean Project Structure**: Organized documentation with lowercase naming convention
- ✅ **Git Repository**: Both Core and Dev scripts committed safely
- ✅ **Tooltip System Discovery**: Successfully confirmed Ikariam's native `bindBubbleTip` integration
- ✅ **Command System Implementation**: Comprehensive AI command system with versioned backup management

### 🤖 Command System Development (2025-06-14)
- ✅ **Versioned Backup System**: Auto-incrementing backup structure with timestamps
- ✅ **20+ Commands Available**: Complete command set for backup, restore, version management, analysis
- ✅ **Smart Organization**: Commands organized by frequency with most important at bottom
- ✅ **Multi-threshold Validation**: Sophisticated backup validation with size analysis
- ✅ **Command Documentation**: Comprehensive command reference with exact procedures
- ✅ **Safety Features**: Backup validation, error checking, detailed reporting
- ✅ **User-friendly Design**: Compact command list optimized for minimal scrolling
- ✅ **File Watcher System**: PowerShell-based command execution through file monitoring
- ⚠️ **Memory Limitations**: Large Core script causes VS Code memory errors - backup system critical
- 🧹 **Project Cleanup**: Removed deprecated stable backup system, documentation updated
- ✅ **Cleanup Completed**: PowerShell one-liner successfully removed all deprecated files
- 🗑️ **Final Cleanup**: Removed temporary command output files and unnecessary cleanup scripts
- 📁 **File Reorganization**: Renamed scripts to be project-agnostic (removed TNT- prefixes)
- 🎯 **File Naming Standards**: Implemented kebab-case naming convention for all files
- 🧹 **Naming Cleanup**: Removed inconsistent file names and deprecated files

### 🔬 Tooltip System Investigation (2025-06-14)
- ✅ **Native System Accessible**: `ikariam.controller.tooltipController` confirmed available
- ✅ **Multiple Methods Available**: `opacity, tooltipWidth, bubbleNode, infoNode, offsetLeft, offsetTop, tooltip, createBubble, createTooltip`
- ✅ **bindBubbleTip Function**: Method exists and can be called successfully without errors
- ✅ **Tooltip Creation**: 19 potential tooltip elements found after calling bindBubbleTip
- ✅ **Hijacking Successful**: Tooltip hijacking confirmed working - intercepted all tooltip calls
- ✅ **Enhancement Working**: Successfully enhanced TNT element tooltips with real data
- ❌ **Visibility Issue**: All created tooltips have `visible: false` - hijacking works but tooltips remain hidden
- 🔄 **Git Restore**: Core script restored to stable v1.5.24 state due to accumulated syntax errors
- 🧹 **Dev Script Cleaned**: Manually cleaned out Dev script to create clean baseline for tooltip development
- 🎯 **Clean Slate Ready**: Dev script empty, ready for fresh custom tooltip implementation
- 📋 **Baseline Documented**: Clean state documented for future restoration
- 🛡️ **Stable Backups Created**: User copied current Dev content to stable backup location

### 🧪 Tooltip Hijacking Test Results (v1.1.2)
- ✅ **Found 55 TNT elements** - All resource cells detected successfully
- ✅ **Hijack installation confirmed** - Green indicator showed "🧪 TNT Dev: Tooltip Hijacking Active"
- ✅ **Manual triggers working** - Mouse hover events properly attached to TNT elements
- ✅ **Enhancement logic working** - Console showed "✅ Enhancing TNT element tooltip!" for each hover
- ✅ **Data access working** - Successfully accessed Ikariam's native resource data
- ❌ **Tooltips not visible** - Despite successful hijacking and enhancement, tooltips remain hidden
- 🔍 **Root cause identified**: Ikariam's `bindBubbleTip` creates tooltips but sets them to invisible

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Core Script (v1.5.24)**: Production-ready, runs independently in its own memory space
- **Dev Script**: Clean state, manually cleaned out for fresh tooltip development
- **Command System**: 20+ commands for comprehensive project management
- **Backup System**: Versioned backups under `/backup/core/` and `/backup/dev/`
- **Documentation**: Clean, current, with deprecated systems removed
- **File Structure**: Organized, no deprecated folders or files
- **Project Root**: Clean, only essential files remain

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Scripts run in isolated memory spaces - cannot directly call each other
- Use `window` object for cross-script communication when needed
- Each script maintains its own independent `tnt` object
- Always test scripts separately to ensure independence

### 🚀 Ready for Development
- ✅ **Tooltip System Investigation**: Native `bindBubbleTip` method confirmed working
- ✅ **Command System Active**: Full backup/restore/version management available
- ✅ **Versioned Backups**: Safe development with complete history preservation
- 🎯 **Tooltip Enhancement Implementation**: Ready to build enhanced tooltips
- 📊 **Enhanced User Experience**: Can add detailed information to resource tables
