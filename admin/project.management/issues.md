# TNT Collection Core Issues

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS ⚠️
- **🚫 USERSCRIPT CONSOLE ACCESS LIMITATION**: Functions created inside userscripts (both @grant and @grant none) **CANNOT** be accessed from browser console
  - Window.functionName assignments don't work from userscripts
  - Console testing requires standalone code blocks, not userscript functions
  - For testing: Create standalone console-pasteable code blocks instead of userscript functions
  - This applies to ALL userscript environments (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, etc.)

## Critical Issues Found
- [x] **City ID detection COMPLETELY FIXED** - Working perfectly for all navigation methods!
  - ✅ URL parameters work correctly (cityId=14490 detected correctly)
  - ✅ **FIXED**: "Show Town" button now handled properly with improved fallback logic
  - ✅ **CONFIRMED**: No more "Using fallback city ID" messages in logs
  - ✅ All navigation methods work: City switches, "Show Town" button, direct URLs
- [x] **Construction highlighting COMPLETELY FIXED** - Detection working perfectly!
  - ✅ Standalone test confirmed: Construction elements found in city with vineyard construction
  - ✅ Simplified detection using `$('.constructionSite').length > 0` working perfectly
  - ✅ Construction HTML confirmed: `<div id="position3" class="position3 building constructionSite animated">`
  - ✅ City highlighting working correctly in resource table
- [x] **🎉 CitySwitcher navigation hijacking RESOLVED** - Fixed in v1.5.24
  - ✅ **SOLUTION**: Modified `checkAndContinue()` to detect direct vs automatic navigation
  - ✅ **RESULT**: Direct Mayor Advisor links work correctly
  - ✅ **STATUS**: All navigation methods verified working

## Current Status
🎉 **ALL MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED - PRODUCTION READY!**
- City ID detection working correctly for all navigation methods
- Construction highlighting working correctly 
- CitySwitcher respects user navigation intent
- Core script stable and fully functional
- Ready for next enhancement projects!

## Success Summary
✅ **All critical issues successfully resolved:**
- **City ID Detection**: Working correctly for all scenarios
- **Construction Detection**: Simplified and reliable  
- **CitySwitcher Logic**: Respects user navigation intent
- **Development Process**: Proven methodology established

## Next Development Opportunities
With core functionality working perfectly, consider these future enhancements:
1. **Icon CSS Implementation** - Replace hardcoded URLs with Ikariam's native CSS structure
2. **Performance Optimizations** - Reduce multiple table builds, optimize city detection calls
3. **Additional Features** - Expand on the solid foundation now established
